# loan-applications

The objective of this project was to utilize python and supervised machine learning to take a deeper look at loan applications. 
These are the questions we set out to answer from the CSV data obtained from Kaggle.
Does being a graduate make a difference in getting approved?
Does being Self Employed make a difference?
Does the avg no of dependents make a difference in getting approved?
Does the total assets affect loan approval?
Does the income to loan amount ratio affect the likelihood of an applicationâ€™s approval?
What will the majority of approved loans be in the future?

We used pandas, tensorflow, and scikit in this assignment. After organizing and splitting the data, this is what we discovered with our model.

Our initial model had an accuracy of 60%. To assess this, we instantiated and resampled the model. This revealed a decrease in our model's accuracy score of 55%. The next approach was to utilize a neural network model for this test. Our final fits and tests provided an accuracy score of 99%.
